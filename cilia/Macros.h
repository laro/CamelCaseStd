//TODO I'd like to have a keyword "var" for type inferring in variable declarations,
//     for "var i = 0", because IMHO it is clearer than the ubiquitous "auto".
//#define var  auto

//TODO I'd like to have a keyword "func" for function declarations,
//     for "func isOpen() -> Bool { ... }", as to avoid the "most vexing parse",
//     abd because IMHO it is clearer than the ubiquitous "auto".
//#define func auto
